# Documentation
This is the folder that contains all you need to generate an up to date version
of the documentation of _pyparsers_ using _sphinx_.

All you need to do in order to get started is to type in the following command:
```
python3 setup.py install
make -C doc html
```

The resulting documentation will be built in the _doc/build_ subfolder.
